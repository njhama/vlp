# Lesson 2: Intelligent Agents
### Agents and Environments
- Agents: entities that perceive the environment through sesnors and act upon the env through their actuators
    - ie: humans, robots, etc
- Percept: content an agents sensors are perceiving

### Rationality


# Lesson 3: Problem Solving via Search

### Problem Types
- Deterministic (fully observable) => single-state problems
    - agent knows which state it will be in
- Non-observable => conformant problem (sensorless)
    - agent has no idea where it is
- Non-deterministic and/or partailly observable => contingency
    - percepts provide new info abt current state
- Unknown state space => exploration 



### Examples

### Search Graphs & Search Trees
#### Graphs Search
##### Directed Graphs

### Search Strategies

#### Time and Cost Measurements
- b: branching factor
- d: depth of least-cost solution
- m: max depth of the state space (depth of search tree)


#### Uniformed Search Strategies
- BFS
- Uniform-cost search
- DFS
- Depth-limited search
- Iterative Deepneing search


###### BFS
- FIFO queue

##### DFS
- LIFO stack

##### Uniform Cost Search (Djikstras)
- Expand least cost unexpanded node

##### Itertive Deepening Search
- get DFS space advantage w/ BFS time advantage

# Lesson 4: Informed Search
### BFS & Greedy
### A* Search
### Admissible Heuristics
### Properties of A* Search
### Local Search & Iterative Improvements
### Gradient Based Algorithms
