## Problem Solving via Search (Ch 3.1 - Ch 3.4)
Problem-solving agent
    : goal-based agent

Informed Search Algo
    : somehting 

---
### Problem Definition
1. Initial State
    : Where the agent starts
    *In(Arad)*
2. Actions
    : What the agent can do next
    *ACTIONS(S) = {Go(Sibiu), Go(Timisoara), Go(Zerind)}.*
3. Transition Model
    : Description of what each agent does
    *RESULT(s,a) = RESULT(In(Arad),Go(Zerind)) = In(Zerind)*
4. Goal Test
    : Determines whether a given state is a goal state
    *GOAL = {In(Bucharest)}*
5. Path Cost
    : Assigned a numeric cost to each path
    *COST = c(state, action, reach state) = c(s,a,s')*

#### Example Problem
![test](/csci360/img/2.png)
- State
    : Determined by the agent location and the dirt locations
1. Initial State
    : Any state can be the inital one
2. Actions
    : L,R,Suck
3. Transition Model
    : As expected
4. Goal Test
    : Checks if all squares are clean
5. Path Cost
    : Each step costs 1
