# Unit 2 

## Pointers (*)
- Declaration
  ```cpp
  int* ptr;
  ```
- Address of Operator (&)
  ```cpp
  int var = 10;
  court << &var; //prints out the address of var
  ```
- Initialization
  ```cpp
  int var = 10;
  int* ptr = &var;  //pointer to the address of var
  ```
- Dereferncing Pointers
  ```cpp
  int var = 10;
  int* ptr = &var;
  int value = *ptr;   //Dereferences the pointer to get the value of var
  ```
