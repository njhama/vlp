# Unit 8 - Karnaugh Maps
- Use Kmaps to synthesize combinations functions with several outputs
- Can determine the apporpriate size and contents of a memory to implement any logic functions

### K Maps
- if used correctly, will always yield a minimal 2-level implmentation

#### K Map Construction

#### K Map View of Theorems
- T9: Covering
    - X + XY = X
- T10: Combining 
    - XY + XY` = X
- T11: Consensus
    - XY + X’Z + ZY = XY + X’Z
- Squares w/ 1 represent minterms that must be in the SOP solution
- Squares w/ 0 represent maxterms that must be included in the POS solution
